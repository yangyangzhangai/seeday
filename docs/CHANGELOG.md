# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

## Documentation Isomorphism Logging Rules

1. Any structural/interface/code-path change must include one changelog line in the same PR.
2. Changelog entries must reference both code path and doc path updates.
3. If `npm run lint:docs-sync` scope is touched, the entry must mention doc-sync impact.

## 2026-03-09 — Moodauto Phase 1 (Rule Regression Tests)

### Added

- Added `Vitest` unit test setup in `package.json` with `test:unit` and `test:unit:watch`, and added `vitest` to `devDependencies`.
- Added `src/services/input/liveInputClassifier.test.ts` with zh seed case coverage for `standalone_mood`, `new_activity`, `activity_with_mood`, and `mood_about_last_activity`, plus additional regression samples and context-bias/no-bias boundaries.
- Added `src/services/input/liveInputContext.test.ts` for recent-activity lookup behavior, including ongoing-priority, 30-minute window acceptance, and mood/chat exclusion.

### Doc-sync impact

- Synced execution checkpoint and next-step focus in `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` (Phase 1 / P1 marked complete; Phase 2 / P0 promoted as next step).
- Synced handover board/log in `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_HANDOVER_PLAN.md` for traceability of test infrastructure and regression coverage landing.

## 2026-03-09 — Moodauto Phase 1 (Auto Recognized Input)

### Changed

- Added rule-based live input classification service under `src/services/input/` (`types.ts`, `liveInputRules.zh.ts`, `liveInputContext.ts`, `liveInputClassifier.ts`) for `activity`/`mood` auto recognition with recent-activity context bias.
- Added `sendAutoRecognizedInput()` in `src/store/useChatStore.ts` as the chat main input entry, and routed `ChatPage` send flow through this unified action.
- Updated record-path mood detection in `src/store/chatActions.ts` to local rule detection only, removing the unconditional classifier API dependency from the primary path.
- Updated `ChatInputBar` and `ChatPage` to a neutral single-input UX (no heart mode toggle) and added `chat_placeholder_neutral` i18n key in `src/i18n/locales/en.ts`, `src/i18n/locales/zh.ts`, and `src/i18n/locales/it.ts`.
- Added `activity_with_mood` writeback in `src/store/useChatStore.ts` to persist derived mood tag and note via `useMoodStore.activityMood` and `useMoodStore.moodNote` without changing message persistence schema.

### Doc-sync impact

- Mainline task status and next checkpoint were synced in `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- Input-path behavior and ownership moved to rule-based service/store entry while keeping module boundary under `src/features/chat` + `src/store` + `src/services/input`.

## 2026-03-07 — Cleanup H5/H6/H7

### Changed

- Completed cleanup task H5 by splitting annotation serverless implementation: `api/annotation.ts` is now a thin route entry, core handler moved to `api/annotation-handler.ts`, and prompt/default-template logic moved to `api/annotation-prompts.ts`.
- Completed cleanup task H6 by extracting `insertActivity` collision/persistence flow from `src/store/useChatStore.ts` into `src/store/chatActions.ts` via `buildInsertedActivityResult` and `persistInsertedActivityResult`; also extracted duration-sync helper flow (`buildMessageDurationUpdate`/`persistMessageDurationUpdate`).
- Completed cleanup task H7 by removing unused heavy dependencies `cannon-es`, `matter-js`, `three`, and `@types/matter-js` from `package.json` and lockfile.
- Synced cleanup decision: H8 (`commit-msg` hook) is marked as stop-execution by user choice and will not be implemented in this round.

### Doc-sync impact

- API route internals changed (`api/annotation.ts` split into entry + handler + prompts) and module docs were synced in `src/api/README.md`.
- Cleanup board and session anchor were synced in `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_HANDOVER_PLAN.md` and `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`.

## 2026-03-06 (续) — Git Hook 自动拦截

### Added

- Added `scripts/check-secrets.mjs`: scans staged files for hardcoded keys/tokens (patterns: `sk-`, `cpk_`, Bearer, Supabase service role). Registered as `npm run lint:secrets`.
- Added `scripts/pre-commit.mjs`: pre-commit hook entry point, runs 4 checks in fast-fail order (secrets → max-lines → doc-sync → tsc).
- Added `scripts/install-hooks.mjs`: installs hook scripts into `.git/hooks/`, auto-runs via `npm run prepare`.
- Added `npm run lint:all`: shortcut running all 4 quality checks.
- Added `npm run prepare`: auto-installs git hooks on `npm install`.
- `LLM.md` expanded into full AI onboarding guide: session SOP (3-step), coding rules, loop checks, doc-sync matrix, prohibited items, and related-doc table.

### Doc-sync impact

- `scripts/` directory: 3 new files, no existing paths changed → `check-doc-sync` scope unaffected.
- `package.json` scripts block changed → no README update required (no API/store/route changes).

## 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added `LLM.md` as the single L1 AI/LLM entry document and removed `CLAUDE.md` from active plan scope.
- Added module-level docs: `src/features/auth/README.md`, `src/features/todo/README.md`, `src/features/report/README.md`, and `src/api/README.md`.
- Added `scripts/check-doc-sync.mjs` and new command `npm run lint:docs-sync`.
- Added `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` as the session-resume anchor file for checkpointed restart.
- Added `scripts/check-state-consistency.mjs` and new command `npm run lint:state-consistency` to block code/doc state drift.

### Changed

- Standardized `src/features/chat/README.md` to the module-template format (entry/interface/upstream/downstream/docs).
- Added `DOC-DEPS` headers to key files (`src/App.tsx`, `src/api/client.ts`, all `src/store/use*Store.ts`, all `api/*.ts`) for L3 file-level dependency tracing.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a required "code change -> doc update" matrix and doc-sync execution rules.
- Updated `LLM.md` global read order to require `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` before project-map/module reads.
- Updated `scripts/check-doc-sync.mjs` required-doc list to include `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with a session resume SOP and mandatory `lint:state-consistency` pre-submit check.

## 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Completed cleanup task F16 by decoupling annotation sync from `todayStats.events` and using `annotations[]` as the source of pending cloud sync records.
- Added `syncedToCloud` to `AIAnnotation` and updated `useAnnotationStore` to mark local annotations unsynced on create, then flip to synced after successful insert/upsert.
- Added capped event retention for `todayStats.events` (`MAX_TODAY_EVENTS = 400`) to prevent unbounded local persisted growth while preserving recent runtime context.
- Synced execution status and handover details into `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_HANDOVER_PLAN.md` (board + handover log entry).
- Completed cleanup tasks F12-F15: introduced `api/http.ts` shared wrappers (CORS/method/error JSON), unified annotation extraction in `src/lib/aiParser.ts`, optimized Stardust lookup/writeback flow, and reduced ChatPage timer hot-path overhead.
- Updated API handlers (`api/chat.ts`, `api/report.ts`, `api/classify.ts`, `api/diary.ts`, `api/stardust.ts`, `api/annotation.ts`) to use shared HTTP helpers for consistent behavior.
- Completed cleanup task F17 by introducing `src/lib/dbMappers.ts` and unifying DB row mapping for Message/Todo/Report/Stardust/Annotation/Auth sync paths.
- Completed cleanup task F18 by migrating Mood domain internal values to English keys (`happy/calm/focused/...`) with i18n-based rendering and persisted-data compatibility migration.

## 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution flow, directory boundaries, validation, and rollback expectations.
- Added `docs/archive/2026-03-04-root-residual-disposition.md` to record root residual file disposition.
- Added `scripts/check-max-lines.mjs` and `npm run lint:max-lines` for file-size guardrails (warn >400 lines, error >800 lines).

### Changed

- Locked package manager strategy to `npm` and removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Updated package-management wording in `README.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and install steps in `DEPLOY.md`.
- Synced cleanup board and handover log for D3, D6, D9, and E1 in `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_HANDOVER_PLAN.md`.
- Reviewed and improved `.gitignore` by removing duplicate `.env` rules and adding `.vercel/` ignore.
- Rewrote `api/README.md` and `src/store/README.md` to align with current implementation boundaries and reduce drift.
- Grouped shared components by responsibility into `src/components/layout` and `src/components/feedback`, then updated imports in app entry points and chat feature.
- Synced cleanup status decision: C12 and C13 are now marked as stop-execution items and will be handled by the user later.
- Corrected documentation alignment across `FEATURE_STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the C12/C13 stop-execution status.

### Removed

- Removed stale root files: `TO-DO.json`, `YOUWARE.md`, and `SECURITY_FIX.md`.

## 2026-03-03

### Added

- Added `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` as the global onboarding context document.
- Added `FEATURE_STATUS.md` to track module-level implementation status.
- Added `docs/CHANGELOG.md` as the single changelog entry point.

### Changed

- Rewrote root `README.md` to reflect real project scope, setup, architecture entry points, and known issues.
- Rewrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect current implemented architecture only.
- Completed C14 by adding bounded pruning strategy in `src/store/useMoodStore.ts` to avoid unbounded localStorage growth.
- Fixed report detail title i18n mismatch in `src/features/report/ReportDetailModal.tsx` and locale keys.
- Synced cleanup board status for C14 and C16 in `docs/CODE_CLEANUP_HANDOVER_PLAN.md`.

### Notes

- C12/C13 are now marked as stop-execution items and are intentionally left for user-owned follow-up.
